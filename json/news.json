A 74-year-old man walked into a Connecticut bookstore and ended up accused of \"spreading a red liquid all over some Kim Kardashian books,\" according to the Glastonbury Police Department's description on Facebook.These weren't any old Kim Kardashian books.

He couldn't, sadly, divulge the actual wording of the note.Kardashian's book of selfies drew a mixed reaction. It currently manages only three stars on Amazon.But to pour red liquid over it is to pour scorn on a modern art form, one that has been embraced by the whole of society.

That word was \"Statistics.\" Beneath that word was a table that showed the various means by which Americans are killed annually. Number of Americans killed by Islamic jihadist immigrants: 2. Number of Americans killed by far right-wing terrorists: 5. Number of Americans killed by toddlers with guns: 21. And number of Americans shot dead by another American: 11,737.This contrasted with Trump's own Sunday morning tweets in support of his new order. \"Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW,\" he tweeted. \"Look what is  happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world -- a horrible mess!\"This he followed with: \"Christians in the Middle-East have been executed in large numbers.

She was also making a peace sign, a clear political statement for our troubled times. This is where her power may now lie. When Trump posts a tweet, it often garners 50,000 to 100,000 likes. Please keep away from sharp objects and even sharper people when I tell you that Kardashian's family photo has now enjoyed more than 4 million likes on Instagram. That is 4 million people offering spontaneous adulation, just like that.\n        \n                            More Technically Incorrect\n                    \n        Man loses BMW in parking garage for six months\n\n                                                                                                                Japanese company replaces white-collar jobs with AI\n\n                                                                                                                With one wrong swipe, South Korea loses $5M worth of weapons\n\n                                                         Kardashian is back on Twitter too. She's posted several pictures of herself and her two children. One emitted on Wednesday has already enjoyed 224,000 likes and 46,000 retweets.By the way, Trump has 18.8 million followers on Twitter. Kardashian dwarfs him with 49.4 million followers on the site. Please consider the potential of that popular power. Imagine if she got together with a few gray-suits such as Mitt Romney, Cory Booker and Seth Meyers to create the Kardocrat  Party. It could attract followers, aka voters, by linking politics to popular activities. It could make selfies compulsory at polling stations, something that would please Justin Timberlake. It could offer daily style tips on social media and decree particular colors for particular political issues. Sample tweet: \"Today we're trying to get a new health care plan approved.

Instead, many on Twitter offered suspicion and even derision.\n                            \n                \n                                \n                                            \n\n\n\n        \n        window.console && console.log && console.log(\"ADS: queuing inpage-video-top-58c399654b5f4 for display\");\n        var cbsiGptDivIds = cbsiGptDivIds || [];\n        cbsiGptDivIds.push(\"inpage-video-top-58c399654b5f4\");\n                            And then there was the National Rifle Association. It took its own typically thoughtful angle to the whole thing. On Twitter, the NRA referenced Kardashian specifically: \"Wait, criminals held @KimKardashian at gunpoint in Paris? How is that possible? Does anyone know if they passed a background check first?\"This shot was followed by another tweet: \"It's shocking that these criminals did not subject themselves to Paris' strict #guncontrol laws before committing this awful crime.\"There's a certain level of sincere sympathy that seems missing in these tweets.You might believe the NRA is a defender of one of the last bastions of American freedom. Or you might believe that it's a congregation of cynical, asinine folks with severe dandruff, whose only interest lies in scaring Americans into owning as many guns as possible.The organization doesn't always comment on every gun-related incident. It sometimes remains silent, for example only offering comment two days after the Orlando massacre. Why target Kardashian so quickly? \n        \n                            More Technically Incorrect\n                    \n        Bill Belichick spikes Microsoft Surface, Patriots still lose\n\n                                                                                                                John Oliver calls for increased use of police bodycams\n\n                                                                                                                Drivers stunned as porn appears on electronic billboard\n\n                                                        It could be because she declared herself a Hillary Clinton supporter. Some believe that the Democratic nominee wants to enact draconian gun control laws, as opposed to what others might describe as the first sane steps to prevent the wrong people --  such as those on the no-fly list -- from buying guns.It could also be because Kardashian actually took to Twitter to support a little gun control. In June, she offered: \"So sad! The senate voted against background checks being needed to buy  guns. So terrorists on fbi's wanted lists can legally still buy guns.\"Kardashian's rep didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Elsewhere in the world, Kim Kardashian has broken the internet again as a top trending topic after the reality mega-star was reported robbed in Paris, an event that prompted Kanye West to cut short his New York City show on Sunday. Social Cues is our daily feature on what's trending across Facebook and Twitter each morning. Here's what's buzzing around social media on Monday: Kim Kardashian: Two robbers disguised as police officers in Paris stormed into Kardashian's luxury apartment in Paris on Sunday, holding her at gunpoint and stealing millions of dollars worth of jewelry. Hubbie Kanye West, who had been performing at the The Meadows concert, abruptly ended his show and told the audience he had to leave for a family emergency. The reality star had been in France for Paris Fashion Week, but left the country after the robbery. She received tweets of support from \"Late Late Show\" host James Corden and from Chrissy Teigen after Twitter users were laughing at the robbery. #TheLastTimeTrumpPaidTaxes: A bombshell report from the New York Times revealed that Donald Trump had not paid taxes for up to 18 years. The newspaper obtained his tax records from 1995, showing the Republican candidate declared a $916 million loss on his 1995 tax return. The hashtag was trending across social media throughout the weekend, criticizing Trump for spending nearly two decades tax-free. Hillary Clinton's campaign jumped in on the fun, creating a \"Smart\" Tax calculator to see how much you would pay in taxes if it were under the same deductions as Trump. (Spoiler: It's $0.) The hits continue to roll in for Trump's campaign on Monday, as New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman presented the Trump Foundation with a cease and desist order.\n                            \n                \n                                \n                                            \n\n\n\n        \n        window.console && console.log && console.log(\"ADS: queuing inpage-video-top-58c386df57bd5 for display\");\n        var cbsiGptDivIds = cbsiGptDivIds || [];\n        cbsiGptDivIds.push(\"inpage-video-top-58c386df57bd5\");\n                              Yoshinori Ohsumi: The Japanese biologist won 2016's Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine for his discoveries of mechanisms in autophagy, a process for recycling cellular material.

Kardashian was so moved by this gesture that she posted a video to Instagram and expressed her movement. Teigen, you see, hadn't just sent a bouquet. She enclosed a heartfelt note: \"I'm so sorry for your loss. I know how much you loved your BB. You were  both very lucky to have each other and you will always have the  memories.

With legendary producer Rick Rubin nonchalantly chilling in the background, the footage shows West as he recites his lyrics to the controversial song \"Famous\" (presumably before his album \"The Life of Pablo\" was released) and Swift appears to sign off on the lyrics via speakerphone, despite their personal, edgy nature and a rocky history between Swift and West. The snaps  seem to contradict Swift's public disapproval of the song and its even more contentious music video. Swift responded to the drama by posting an iOS notes on Twitter and Instagram.That moment when Kanye West secretly records your phone call, then Kim posts it on the Internet.A photo posted by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Jul 17, 2016 at 9:14pm PDT  When I woke up this morning and realized all of the drama wasn't on Twitter, for the first time in my life I thought, \"Why am I not following Kim on Snapchat?!\" So why did Kardashian-West post on Snapchat? Why not put the footage in an episode of \"Keeping Up With The Kardashians\"? (Kardashian-West calls out Swift for playing the victim in footage of \"KUWTK\", but she doesn't share video of the phone call.) Or post on Instagram? Or upload it onto Facebook or Twitter? Heck, why didn't she upload it onto her official app, the one subscribers pay monthly for?\n                            \n                \n                                \n                                            \n\n\n\n        \n        window.console && console.log && console.log(\"ADS: queuing inpage-video-top-58c399689c8ef for display\");\n        var cbsiGptDivIds = cbsiGptDivIds || [];\n        cbsiGptDivIds.push(\"inpage-video-top-58c399689c8ef\");\n                             I think Kardashian-West knew exactly what she was doing, and she did it right. As Taylor Swift's seemingly perfect, cookie-cutter facade slowly crumbles, Kardashian West's legendary social media savvy quickly earns its vaunted reputation. Kardashian West's choice to distribute the video on Snapchat is a move to expand her notoriety and presence on the platform. Kardashian West is known for using Instagram and Twitter to her advantage; her \"must-follow\" status on the internet is largely due to sharing nude selfies and controversial tweets. However, Snapchat is considered the wheelhouse of her younger siblings. Out of all the popular social media sites, Snapchat is the youthful, cool, edgy one. And what's edgier than calling out America's Sweetheart? The footage Kardashian West unleashed is the dirty, nitty-gritty details gossipmongers dream of. The drawn-out, dramatic vignettes of the conversation make for must-see water-cooler fodder. Snapchat is largely focused on sharing live, in-the-moment photos and videos. Kim, however, flipped the script by purposefully choosing to share (what is assumed to be) an old video -- one that would definitely garners tons of attention.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n                            \n                \n                                \n                                            \n\n\n\n        \n        window.console && console.log && console.log(\"ADS: queuing replay-wide-top-58c399689c8ef for display\");\n        var cbsiGptDivIds = cbsiGptDivIds || [];\n        cbsiGptDivIds.push(\"replay-wide-top-58c399689c8ef\");\n                             Maybe the #SocialMediaQueen was just making good use of the new Memories feature. Or, maybe, after establishing a prodigious Instagram and Twitter presence, Kim has her sights set on dominating Snapchat. In kicking off the drama by coyly tweeting a thirst trap (definition: an obvious ploy for attention), this fiasco proves that no one's better at leveraging popularity to gain even more popularity better than Kim. There's no way to easily find out how many more Snapchat followers Kim has now (Snapchat doesn't release account details of users) or if her clout with the younger audience has improved. What I know, is that I now follow Kim on Snapchat and, if I ever have a private phone conversation with Kanye West, I'll be sure to ask him if he's recording it.\n\n        \n                                                        \n    \n\n        \n        \n    Share your voice\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                                    0\n                                comments\n            \n        \n    \n            \n                                \n\n            Tags\n    \n                        Crave\n            \n                        Tech Culture\n            \n                        Kim Kardashian\n                                Snapchat\n                                Taylor Swift\n                                ","date":"July 18, 2016 4:05 PM PDT","type":"news"},{"source":"cnet","url":"http:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/kanye-west-kim-kardashian-taylor-swift-feud-in-frighteningly-low-resolution\/","title":"\n                Kanye vs. Taylor plays out online in frighteningly low resolution\n        \u200bDo you love watching celebrity feuds on the internet in all their blurry glory?

Global sales of game discs for PCs and video game consoles like Sony's PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's Xbox One are expected to drop to about $18 billion in 2020, down from nearly $21 billion last year. Meanwhile, sales of games over the internet are expected to jump 57 percent to nearly $13 billion over that same time.The bottom line, according to PwC, is that gamers are increasingly shifting their purchases to online stores like Valve's Steam Store. Add in other items sold through apps and the internet, like new uniforms for popular characters in titles like League of Legends, and global spending on games is expected to rise more than 20 percent to $85.4 billion in the next four years.\"Just as with PCs, much of this will be driven by access to more free-to-play (F2P) titles, some of which will be e-sport related,\" PwC said in its report.\n        \n                            More video game happenings\n                    \n        PlayStation 4 sales leap past 40 million\n\n                                                                                                                Ubisoft bringing The Division to the silver screen\n\n                                                                                                                Grand Theft Auto V, closing in on Minecraft, ships 65 million units\n\n                                                        \n                            \n                \n                                \n                                            \n\n\n\n        \n        window.console && console.log && console.log(\"ADS: queuing inpage-video-top-58c3996b2416e for display\");\n        var cbsiGptDivIds = cbsiGptDivIds || [];\n        cbsiGptDivIds.push(\"inpage-video-top-58c3996b2416e\");\n                            It's a shift the industry has spent more than a decade preparing for. Game makers like Valve, Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo and Electronic Arts have spent the past decade building online stores designed to help gamers buy and play games without ever touching a disc.Still, some gamers have resisted the change, opting to keep buying physical copies of games on discs, just like they have been for decades.

These act like humectants (i.e. keep moisture in), so removing them makes you feel dry.'In fact, she warns, 'over washing often paradoxically gives an odor due to the vulva increasing oil production and the change in bacteria'.\u00a0The one thing she warns against is the kind of cleansing wipes Khloe recommends.\u00a0'Never use baby wipes or hygiene sprays or douches or feminine wipes. EVER,' Dr Gunter says.\u00a0'These will strip oils and possibly change your bacterial colonization from good to bad.'\u00a0\u00a0Dr Gunter insists we should altogether avoid soap on the vulva, or use an unscented Castile soap or pure glycerin soap.                            WHAT IS VAGINAL BACTERIA?\u00a0                            Compared with those of other mammals, the human vagina is unique.\u00a0As warm, moist canals exposed to all sorts of things including penises, babies and dirt, most mammalian vaginas harbor a diverse mix of bacteria.\u00a0However, for many women, one or another species of Lactobacillus has become the dominant bacterial resident.WHAT THESE BACTERIA DOLactobacillus bacteria pump out lactic acid, which keeps the vaginal environment at a low, acidic pH that kills or discourages other bacteria, yeast and viruses from thriving.\u00a0There are even hints that certain Lactobacillus species reinforce the mucus in the vagina that acts as a natural barrier to invaders.\u00a0BRIEF HISTORY OF VAGINAL BACTERIAAlthough no one knows for sure, researchers speculate that human vaginas gained their Lactobacillus protectors around 10,000\u201312,000 years ago when humans began fermenting milk and eating foods like yogurt and cheese, which are full of the bacteria.Certain Lactobacillus may have expanded their territory to colonize the vagina \u2013 travelling the short distance from the anus to the vaginal opening.\u00a0There, they found their perfect environment, a low-oxygen chamber that, during a woman's reproductive years, has an abundant supply of the sugars Lactobacillus feed upon.For the most part, we've been happily cohabitating ever since, but it's a delicate balancing act.\u00a0DIFFERENT FROM WOMAN TO WOMAN\u00a0Researchers are realizing that all\u00a0Lactobacillus\u00a0bacteria \u2013 long thought to keep vaginas healthy \u2013 are not created equal.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2011, a study\u00a0found five different types of bacterial community.\u00a0Four of these were dominated by different\u00a0Lactobacillus species.But the fifth contained a diverse mix of microbes (including Gardnerella, Sneathia, Eggerthella and Mobiluncus species), many of which have been associated with bacterial vaginosis.\u00a0CLEANING PRODUCTS MAKE IT WORSEDouching of any kind disrupts the balance of good bacteria and is associated with increased risk of BV.\u00a0Folklore about the need to clean out the vagina \u2013 especially after sex or a period \u2013 is often handed down from older relatives to younger women.\u00a0But the vagina is remarkably adept at taking care of itself if left undisturbed.'Your vagina is like a self-cleaning oven,' says gynecologist Denise Willers. It doesn't need any special help.The companies behind these products know that many women are looking for ways to counter embarrassing and debilitating symptoms such as vaginal odour and discharge.Nearly one-third of US women of reproductive age have it at any given time. The sad truth is that these sprays, soaps and wipes will not fix the problem.\u00a0They will \u2013 in many cases \u2013 actually make it worse.\u00a0WHAT YOU\u00a0CAN DO TO GET A HEALTHY VAGINA\u00a0Professor Janneke van de Wijgert, of the University of Liverpool, is currently testing two vaginal probiotic products in Rwanda to see if they can prevent BV recurrences.Both products, capsules inserted into the vagina, are available over the counter in Europe.\u00a0However, they contain Lactobacillus strains found in both the vagina and the intestine, some of which have a poor record of colonizing the vagina effectively.\u00a0In the US, Craig Cohen, now a professor of obstetrics, gynaecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California, has launched the next phase of the only clinical trial of a vaginal probiotic that contains L. crispatus, called LACTIN-V.\u00a0'The health burden of not having good vaginal microbiota is enormous,' says Richard Cone, a biophysicist who studies vaginal mucus at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.\u00a0\u00a0'Anything we can to do help more women, more of the time, have Lactobacillus crispatus in their vaginas, then the world will be a better place.'                                                    <br>","date":"\n  23:37 GMT, 10 March 2017\n<br>","type":"news"},{"source":"Dailymail<br>","url":"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/tvshowbiz\/article-4302694\/Kim-Kardashian-lookalike-Bachelor-contestant-lawyer.html","title":"Will she be the next Anna Heinrich?

have been one of the greatest weekends a father could plan for his girls, with Barack then taking the girls on a private tour of the Whitney and scoring the group 'Hamilton' tickets for the following day.\u00a0Barack and the girls came with an appetite that night too, ordering the restaurants famed veal parmigiana, crab cakes, a porterhouse for two, spicy rigatoni alla vodka, meatballs, lobster ravioli, and a bottle of Fenocchio Barbaresco.\u00a0And while the food, which is carefully crafted by co-chefs\u00a0Mario Carbone and Rich Torrisi, is some of the best in the city, it does come at a bit of a cost.The veal parmigiana is $55 and the porterhouse for two rings in at $195, though it does come with an incredible tableside presentation in addition to the perfectly grilled 60-day dry-aged cut from Pat LaFrieda.Michelle also visited Carbone back in November of 2013 just a few months after the restaurant opened its doors, and sat across the room from reality star Kim Kardashian who was dining with her publicist pal Simon Huck.<br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\nSnow way: Malia was up and at 'em early Friday as she

boots that really caught our attention. <br \/>\n                        The former First Daughter has been spotted on numerous occasions wearing these biker boots by 3.1 Phillip Lim, which only goes to show that they are totally worth the investment.  <br \/>\n                        We love the biker zip accents and snuggly shearling lining. More often than not, dreamy boots come with a nightmare stiletto heel so the combination of style and comfort is perfection! <br \/>\n                        Click the link (right) to buy them now at Shopbop, or make like Malia in a pair of boots from the edit below.

Secret Service agents stand outside Carbone back in 2015 when Barack visited with Sasha and Malia\u00a0    <br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\n    Gridlock: The extra security precautions taken while Barack was in office created a major traffic situation during that 2015 visit (above)Malia has been enjoying quite a few of the city's great restaurants since moving her, with visits from her dad helping to absorb the costs of dining out for the teenager, who heads to Harvard University later this year.\u00a0Barack paid a visit to Malia just two weeks ago in fact, his first time emerging in public since he boarded a marine helicopter bound for Joint Andrews Air Force Base after President Donald Trump was sworn into office.\u00a0The pair seemed to stick to their tradition of great food and great theater, visiting the Italian restaurant Emilio's Ballato one night and taking some time to pose for a photo with the owners and chef.Later that week, the two caught Mark Ruffalo, Danny DeVito, John Turturro, Tony Shalhoub and Jessica Hecht\u00a0in the Broadway revival of Arthur Miller's 'The Price.'It was the Monday after that trip that news broke of Barack and Michelle's staggering book deal.\u00a0Just a few hours after multiple people with knowledge of the joint publishing deal told the Financial Times that bidding had surpassed $60million, The New York Times reveals that the couple had inked a deal with Penguin Random House.\u00a0It was Penguin who appeared to have the slight edge in the battle for the books, having published Barack's three previous titles.\u00a0'We are absolutely thrilled to continue our publishing partnership with President and Mrs. Obama,' the chief executive of Penguin Random House, Markus Dohle, said in a statement.'With their words and their leadership, they changed the world, and every day, with the books we publish at Penguin Random House, we strive to do the same.'Dohle then added: 'Now, we are very much looking forward to working together with President and Mrs. Obama to make each of their books global publishing events of unprecedented scope and significance.'    <br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\n    Wine and dine: Two weeks ago Barack took Malia to dinner at\u00a0Emilio's Ballato (above posing with the owners and chef)    <br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\n    Great dad: Barack is not only an accomplished politician, but also a foodie (above at\u00a0Emilio's Ballato)As part of the deal Penguin will also donate 1million books in the Obamas name, a move that might have taken down the price paid in the deal.There is no release date for either of the memoirs.No book deal has ever come close to paying an author that much money, with the closest example being the the $150million James Patterson reportedly received from Hachette in 2009 as part of a 17-book deal.That breaks down to a little less than $10million a book, as opposed to he $30million Barack and Michelle each stand to make in their deal.The amount currently on the table for the Obamas also eclipses the $15million Bill Clinton was paid for his post-White House memoir My Life which was released

Bush for the 2010 release Decision Points.It also four times more than the reported $14million Hillary Clinton earned for her 2014 release Hard Choices about her time at the State Department.She received $8million over a decade prior on 2001 for her first memoir, Living History. She was a New York senator at that time and had to have the deal approved by the Senate Ethics Committee.President Donald Trump meanwhile received just a $500,000 advance for The Art of the Deal, which he split with the ghost writer of the book.That book has gone on however to earn him millions in royalties, having made its way back on the bestsellers list back in 2004 when he launched The Apprentice and ever since announced his candidacy for president.\u00a0<br>","date":"\n  21:14 GMT, 10 March 2017\n<br>","type":"news"},{"source":"Dailymail<br>","url":"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/article-4302160\/Louis-Tomlinson-s-airport-brawl-revealed-police-report.html","title":"EXCLUSIVE: 'I may have taken him down.'

Tomlinson had his hand out in front of his face to block the camera. He then grabbed Larsen's leg and threw Larsen to the ground.'At the same time, Calder tried to walk out from the terminal. However, suddenly Calder came over and attacked Becerra Herrera, Ana (who was sitting on the chair). Lyons believed Becerra Herrera was trying to film Calder.'Lyons saw Calder punched Becerra Herrera.'The report also states the cops took several photos of Becerra Herrera's injuries and that some of the fight was caught on an American Airline security camera but they were yet to view the footage.Tomlinson is due in court on March 29 and could be jailed for up to six months if convicted.\u00a0

with tracksuits.In reality, however, the hoodie and track pant set is designed by a super-expensive French brand and would have cost the pop star and his girlfriend closer to \u00a31,100 a

and Michelle Obama celebrate $60m book deal over wine and Italian food at NYC eatery with daughter Malia (who sticks with water)<br>","content":"Barack Obama was back in the Big Apple on Thursday night, and used his visit as an excuse to stop by his favorite restaurant for a little wine and a lot of Italian food.The former president was spotted at Carbone with his wife Michelle and daughter Malia, who moved to Manhattan in January ahead of her new internship at The Weinstein Company.Barack could be seen enjoying a glass of red wine and chowing down on the $49 double lamb chop at the Michelin-starred Italian joint, while Michelle opted for a bit of white wine with her meal and 18-year-old Malia was stuck with water.There was plenty of reasons to celebrate too, approximately 60million according to one report, which claims that is the amount Barack and Michelle have secured for the global rights to their upcoming memoirs.The money should help the Obamas, with Barack recently out of a job and Malia the only member of the family who has a job at this time.\u00a0Sasha meanwhile is still attending high school in Washington DC, which is why she could not join her parents and sister for their Manhattan dinner party.Scroll down for video\u00a0    <br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\n    Family guy:\u00a0Barack Obama went out to eat at the Italian

\/>\nBarack has made a habit of visiting Carbone when he is in the city, previously swinging by with his daughters in July of 2015 while he was in town for a fundraiser with Sasha.Due to the fact that Barack was the commander-in-chief when the visit occurred, the area around Carbone was slowed to a near-standstill due to the presence of Secret Service.Malia was working in the city at that time, with the motivated teenager electing to spend the summer between her junior and senior year at Sidwell Friends working on the set of Lena Dunham's HBO series 'Girls.'<br \/>\n  <br \/>\n    <br \/>\n

then taking the girls on a private tour of the Whitney and scoring the group 'Hamilton' tickets for the following day.\u00a0Barack and the girls came with an appetite that night too, ordering the restaurants famed veal parmigiana, crab cakes, a porterhouse for two, spicy rigatoni alla vodka, meatballs, lobster ravioli, and a bottle of Fenocchio Barbaresco.\u00a0And while the food, which is carefully crafted by co-chefs\u00a0Mario Carbone and Rich Torrisi, is some of the best in the city, it does come at a bit of a cost.The veal parmigiana is $55 and the porterhouse for two rings in at $195, though it does come with an incredible tableside presentation in addition to the perfectly grilled 60-day dry-aged cut from Pat LaFrieda.Michelle also visited Carbone back in November of 2013 just a few months after the restaurant opened its doors, and sat across the room from reality star Kim Kardashian who was dining with her publicist pal Simon Huck.<br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br

internship in New York, but she certainly did so in style! <br \/>\n                        She layered up in an oversized green scarf and a red parka, but it was her boots that really caught our attention. <br \/>\n                        The former First Daughter has been spotted on numerous occasions wearing these biker boots by 3.1 Phillip Lim, which only goes to show that they are totally

Secret Service agents stand outside Carbone back in 2015 when Barack visited with Sasha and Malia\u00a0    <br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\n    Gridlock: The extra security precautions taken while Barack was in office created a major traffic situation during that 2015 visit (above)Malia has been enjoying quite a few of the city's great restaurants since moving her, with visits from her dad helping to absorb the costs of dining out for the teenager, who heads to Harvard University later this year.\u00a0Barack paid a visit to Malia just two weeks ago in fact, his first time emerging in public since he boarded a marine helicopter bound for Joint Andrews Air Force Base after President Donald Trump was sworn into office.\u00a0The pair seemed to stick to their tradition of great food and great theater, visiting the Italian restaurant Emilio's Ballato one night and taking some time to pose for a photo with the owners and chef.Later that week, the two caught Mark Ruffalo, Danny DeVito, John Turturro, Tony Shalhoub and Jessica Hecht\u00a0in the Broadway revival of Arthur Miller's 'The Price.'It was the Monday after that trip that news broke of Barack and Michelle's staggering book deal.\u00a0Just a few hours after multiple people with knowledge of the joint publishing deal told the Financial Times that bidding had surpassed $60million, The New York Times reveals that the couple had inked a deal with Penguin Random House.\u00a0It was Penguin who appeared to have the slight edge in the battle for the books, having published Barack's three previous titles.\u00a0'We are absolutely thrilled to continue our publishing partnership with President and Mrs. Obama,' the chief executive of Penguin Random House, Markus Dohle, said in a statement.'With their words and their leadership, they changed the world, and every day, with the books we publish at Penguin Random House, we strive to do the same.'Dohle then added: 'Now, we are very much looking forward to working together with President and Mrs. Obama to make each of their books global publishing events of unprecedented scope and significance.'    <br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\n    Wine and dine: Two weeks ago Barack took Malia to dinner at\u00a0Emilio's Ballato (above posing with the owners and chef)    <br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\n    Great dad: Barack is not only an accomplished politician, but also a foodie (above at\u00a0Emilio's Ballato)As part of the deal Penguin will also donate 1million books in the Obamas name, a move that might have taken down the price paid in the deal.There is no release date for either of the memoirs.No book deal has ever come close to paying an author that much money, with the closest example being the the $150million James Patterson reportedly received from Hachette in 2009 as part of a 17-book deal.That breaks down to a little less than $10million a book, as opposed to he $30million Barack and Michelle each stand to make in their deal.The amount currently on the table for the Obamas also eclipses the $15million Bill Clinton was paid for his post-White House memoir My Life which was released in 2004, and the $10million deal score by George W. Bush for the 2010 release Decision Points.It also four times more than the reported $14million Hillary Clinton earned for her 2014 release Hard Choices about her time at the State Department.She received $8million over a decade prior on 2001 for her first memoir, Living History. She was a New York senator at that time and had to have the deal approved by the Senate Ethics Committee.President Donald Trump meanwhile received just a $500,000 advance for The Art of the Deal, which he split with the ghost writer of the book.That book has gone on however to earn him millions in royalties, having made its way back on the bestsellers list back in 2004 when he launched The Apprentice and ever since announced his candidacy for president.\u00a0<br>","date":"\n  16:37 GMT, 10 March 2017\n<br>","type":"news"},{"source":"Dailymail<br>","url":"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/tvshowbiz\/article-4300042\/The-Bachelor-girls-wear-bin-bags-enter-mansion.html","title":"Not so glamorous after all, hey ladies?

she stood in white sweats and a nude tube top, grinning while a makeup artist ran a brush over her cheek.In the following video, she was still having her makeup done, but her filter had popped leopard ears on her head and a yellow surgical mask on her face with designs resembling a leopard's snout and mouth.    <br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\n    Still having the makeup

'INSECTILE' smoky-eye make-up to CHAIN-embellished manicures: See the most outrageous Fashion Week beauty looks from New York to Paris<br>","content":"Every season there are certain shows at Fashion Week that you just know will bring out the crazy, wacky and, yes, sometimes even ugly hair, make-up and nail looks.Whether the designer is going for shock value, unparalleled originality, or ground-breaking innovation, these bold statements serve to remind us that fashion shows are, above all, a true art form.The fall 2017 season in New York City, London, Milan and Paris has officially come to a close, and, as far as balls-to-the-wall beauty goes, this has been one for the books.Below, we round up the biggest eyebrow-raising trends spotted on the runways.FACE EMBELLISHMENTS'It's all about creating a new texture and evolution of make-up as texture,' said Aaron De Mey of the herringbone fabric appliques he used in place of lipstick and eyebrow pencil backstage at Thom Browne's fall show.\u00a0Pat McGrath was on the same page at Gucci, where she adorned models' cheeks, lips and eyes with materials like crystals and black feathers.\u00a0Thick gold rings were placed over bare lips at Balmain, and pearls applied with Duo adhesive dotted faces at Manish Arora.The award for Most Otherworldly Look, however, goes to Val Garland, who led the make-up team backstage at Gareth Pugh.\u00a0Customized three-dimensional\u00a0'bug eyes' were adhered over eyes on top of layers of black and deep teal pigment to create an 'insectile effect'.    <br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\n    Fly girl: A model at Gucci wore a feathered wig and feathers around her eyes<br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\nBedazzled

bright and textured nail looks that took artists at CND 400 hours to produce ahead of Libertine's show during New York Fashion Week.\u00a0Painted roses in a variety of hues anchored each design and were then embellished further with thread, gems, feathers and chains.\u00a0Across town on the same day, nail artist Mei Kawajiri was busy taking the pierced nail trend (seen recently on the likes of Kim Kardashian) to the next level for Philipp Plein's show by hanging chains, hoops and safety pins from black acrylic manicures.<br \/>\n  <br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      RELATED ARTICLES<br \/>\n

Chain links: The impractical pierced nail trend made an appearance at Philipp Plein's show during New York Fashion WeekABSTRACT EYE DESIGNSThe takeaway from shows like Maison Margiela and Versus Versace was that if you're going to wear brightly colored eyeshadow, don't even think about holding back.Pat McGrath  used what seemed like every pigment color in the rainbow to create out-there winged eye looks at Maison Margiela in Paris, while at Yohji Yamamoto she smudged black and red pigments around and across models' eyes.A colorblock smudgy look was also spotted on the Versus Versace runway in Milan. 'She\u2019s tough and her eye make-up is very bold and graphic to match,' make-up artist Lucia\u00a0Pieroni told\u00a0WWD backstage.\u00a0In  London, Hello Kitty inspired the pastel two-tone eye make-up at Ryan Lo and in New York City, make-up lead Erin Parsons used red velvet and glitter to achieve what she called a 'Muppet' look at LRS.    <br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\n    Soft and sparkly: Glitter and velvet were used to achieve the make-up look for the LRS presentation<br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\nBlurred lines: When creating the eye looks at Yohji Yamamoto (left) and Versus Versace (right), precision was not the goal<br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\nRainbow brite: Backstage at both Maison Margiela (left) and Ryan Lo (right), one vibrant eyeshadow color was simply not enough<br>","date":"\n  21:54 GMT, 8 March 2017\n<br>","type":"news"},{"source":"Dailymail<br>","url":"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/tvshowbiz\/article-4290936\/Kylie-Jenner-shows-tiny-waistline-grey-outfit.html","title":"Back to selfies!

It was about me loving every part of me and being OK with who I was no matter what I looked like \u2014 even though the guy I loved and wanted to marry didn't see me in that way.'However, Chanel admitted that after they broke up, she gained weight because she started eating her feelings, and she ultimately felt even worse.\u00a0'I had to love myself first before anyone else could love me,' she explained.Over the past few days, Chanel has continued her project by sharing videos of herself thanking her supporters, and most recently, a clip of her taking one of Tracy Anderson's fitness classes.\u00a0\u00a0As part of her journey, she is working out and focusing on eating healthy nutritious meals and snacks. But she doesn't have a certain weight loss goal in mind; she just wants to live her best life. \u00a0'My goal by the end of this project is to be fit and get myself back in to shape so I can be healthier than ever \u2014 mind, body, and soul,' she explained.\u00a0'I hope to find my true happiness and love every inch of my body.'\u00a0<br>","date":"\n  18:30 GMT, 7 March 2017\n<br>","type":"news"},{"source":"Dailymail<br>","url":"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/tvshowbiz\/article-4289686\/Kendall-Jenner-joins-Bella-Gigi-Hadid-Chanel.html","title":"Kendall Jenner flaunts her tiny waist in a cropped fur jacket as she joins supermodel sisters Bella and Gigi Hadid after the Chanel show at Paris Fashion Week<br>","content":"They were the standout models at Chanel's AW17 show for Paris Fashion Week on Tuesday.\u00a0And Kendall Jenner, and Bella and Gigi Hadid proved that they can turn just as many heads off the runway as they dazzled whilst leaving the\u00a0Grand Palais after storming the catwalk.\u00a0Leading the way, Kendall, 21, showed off her style prowess in a cropped fur jacket that sheathed her lithe frame and ensured all eyes would be firmly on her as she sashayed out of the building.Scroll down for video<br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\nModel moment:\u00a0Kendall Jenner, and Bella and Gigi Hadid proved that they can turn just as many heads off the runway as they dazzled whilst leaving the Grand Palais after storming the catwalk at the Chanel Paris Fashion Week show on Tuesday\u00a0<br \/>\n    window.FFF = window.FFF || {};<br \/>\n    window.FFF.ad = window.FFF.ad || {inline: {adAdded: false}, overlay: {celebNames: ''}};<br \/>\n    window.FFF.ad.overlay.celebNames = '';

Kendall is seen imitating Elle King in the ad and she certainly looks like a rockstar in that ensemble.<br \/>\n                        Kendall is donning a dress by Moschino in the clip and it's rather quirky with its biker style bandeau top adjoined to a pretty asymmetric skirt in a scarlet red hue.<br \/>\n                        We love the biker zips and how it imitates a leather jacket perfectly, other than its bandeau finish. The red draping skirt gives it a fabulous girly vibe contrast.<br \/>\n                        Sadly it is now sold out, but click right to shop Moschino's current line.<br \/>\n                        There isn't anything much like this dress around the web, but you can snap up a bandeau red midi below. A simpler way to nail the look is to pop your favourite biker over the top and wear it half zipped and off shoulder.<br \/>\n                    <br \/>\n                <br \/>\n            <br \/>\n

That, they sneer, is \u2018demeaning to women.\u2019Under normal circumstances, I wouldn\u2019t disagree with Emma\u2019s assessment; the photos are inarguably interesting and beautiful.But how does exposing her breasts to the world fit with Emma\u2019s condemnation of Beyonc\u00e9 doing the same?A generous observer might say \u2018uneasily\u2019.A less generous observer would brand it flaming hypocrisy.I don\u2019t want to be too harsh on Emma Watson, not least because she is still young and should be allowed to evolve her views as she ages.She\u2019s also in many ways a very impressive young lady \u2013 an excellent actress who conducts admirable work as a United Nations ambassador.    <br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\n    By posing for  Vanity Fair, Emma exposed herself to some as a feminist fraudIn interviews, she comes across as intelligent and thoughtful, and she clearly cares passionately about this issue.But by posing for this Vanity Fair photo, she exposed not just her breasts.She also exposed herself to some as a feminist fraud; someone who professes to want other women to have the \u2018freedom and liberation\u2019 to decide how they behave as feminists, but who actually wants to dictate to them how they behave as feminists.Beyonc\u00e9 flashing her flesh to sell an album in the name of feminism dismayed Emma, because she feared it would simply serve to titillate men.Yet she sees no conflict in doing the same thing herself, while promoting, with almost comical inappropriateness, the new Disney kids movie Beauty And The Beast.We live in an age when the debate about feminism, women\u2019s rights and sexism rightly rages hard, and men, as I know only too well, tip their toe into the fire at their peril.But on the general principle, it shouldn\u2019t be difficult to find consensus.For instance, I agree whole-heartedly with Emma Watson\u2019s own overview: \u2018Fighting for women\u2019s rights has too often become synonymous with man-hating. This has to stop. For the record, feminism is the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities. It is the theory of the political, economic and social equality of the sexes.\u2019She\u2019s absolutely right. But other female celebrities don\u2019t seem to have got the memo.Every time Madonna rants and raves at a women\u2019s march about blowing up Donald Trump, the cause of feminism is damaged.Just as it is when Kim Kardashian posts another bird-flipping topless selfie, supposedly in the name of \u2018female empowerment\u2019.Or, as happened at a Welsh university in Britain this week, when students are told that they can\u2019t use words like \u2018mankind\u2019 or \u2018sportsmanship\u2019 any more because they are \u2018gender-offensive.\u2019None of this nonsense helps anyone, particularly when there are far more important battles to fight.<br \/>\n  <br \/>\n  <br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThis weekend, a Polish politician actually said in the European parliament during a debate on the gender pay gap, that \u2018women must earn less than men, because they are weaker, they are smaller, they are less intelligent\u2019.Now THAT is outrageous sexism and if there\u2019s a march to get this despicable misogynist dinosaur sacked, count me in.But let\u2019s also have some rational perspective to counter the more rabid, headline-grabbing brand of feminism.Right now, the five most powerful people in Emma Watson\u2019s home country are all women: Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II; Prime Minister, Theresa May; Scottish First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon; Home Secretary, Amber Rudd; and Metropolitan Police Commander, Cressida Dick.With the exception of the Queen \u2013 who has turned out to be arguably the most successful Monarch of all time - they all got there strictly on merit.As Oprah Winfrey put it so perfectly: \u2018Excellence is the best deterrent to racism and sexism.\u2019\u00a0<br>","date":"\n  14:59 GMT, 6 March 2017\n<br>","type":"news"},{"source":"Dailymail<br>","url":"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/article-4285546\/Woman-Louis-Tomlinson-fight-claims-DIED.html","title":"Louis Tomlinson fans 'send airport bust-up girl 2,000 online threats making her too scared to leave her house'\u00a0<br>","content":"The woman involved in an airport bust up with Louis Tomlinson has been sent 2,000 abusive online messages from his fans, according to reports.Ana Becerra, 22, was pulled to the floor by the One Direction star as he was defending his girlfriend, Eleanor Calder.\u00a0Trolls have also set up fake social media profiles in her name, including a Twitter account that has discussed Louis.\u00a0<br \/>\n  <br \/>\n  <br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n    <br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\n    Pulled apart: Ana Becerra claims she is the girl in grey thrown to the ground during a fight with 1D star Louis Tomlinson (centre in blue) and his girlfriend Eleanor in LAX on Friday    <br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\n    Fury: The singer looks back at Miss Becerra after the fight as she gesticulates at him before saying she would press charges<br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\nWar of words: Ana Becerra, 22, has accused Louis of hitting her after she pulled out her phone to film his row with a photographer taking pictures of his 24-year-old girlfriend Eleanor Calder at Los Angeles Airport    <br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\n    'Socked': Miss Becerra says she was left with a cut face and claims she was hit in the stomach and was vomiting two hours after the fight with Louis and his partner, who had landed at LAX after a break in Las Vegas.    <br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\n        <br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\n        <br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\n    An account claiming to belong to Ana Becerra says that Louis could have killed her - but she is facing abuse from others who claim she 'started' it by trying to film his row with a photographerA friend of Ms Becerra told The Sun's\u00a0James Beal: 'Ana and her family have received more than 2,000 threatening messages on social media and she\u2019s trying to find a decent lawyer.'It comes after a Twitter account claiming to be owned by\u00a0Ms Becerra said she 'could have died' from a brain haemorrhage.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Doubts have been cast on whether the Twitter account actually belongs to\u00a0Ms Becerra or if it was set up by a troll.\u00a0The 22-year-old has accused Louis of punching her\u00a0after\u00a0she\u00a0pulled out her phone to film his row with a photographer taking pictures of his\u00a024-year-old girlfriend Eleanor Calder at Los Angeles Airport.Miss Becerra says she was left with a cut face and\u00a0was hit in the stomach during the fight with Louis and his partner, who had landed at LAX on Friday after a break in Las Vegas.In the face of threats and abuse from his supporters the account claiming to be her tweeted claims that Louis was an inadequate father, he has been unfaithful and has smoked cannabis, adding: 'And now he beats women'.Astonishing footage of the fight has appeared online and the hashtag #WeSupportLouis is trending among his fans who say he and Eleanor are the real victims, with one witness telling MailOnline Louis' girlfriend was hit in the face and throat by a gang of girls.Tomlinson, who is said to be worth \u00a340million, recently rekindled his romance with Miss Calder after an on-off relationship from several years ago.<br \/>\n  <br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      RELATED ARTICLES<br \/>\n      Previous<br \/>\n        1<br \/>\n        2<br \/>\n        Next<br \/>\n      <br \/>\n    <br \/>\n\t<br \/>\n          Wrong Direction!

People can get arrested for this! I hope they find out who is behind this. Its dangerous & not a joke!'She said that her mother told her that the swatter in that incident told police that a shooting had occurred in the home, to which 15 SWAT officers and three helicopters responded.Other celebs targeted in past swatting pranks include Justin Bieber, Tom Cruise, Simon Cowell and Ashton Kutcher.<br \/>\n  <br \/>\n  <br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n    <br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\n    False alarm: Kim's rep confirmed to Us Weekly that the reality star was not swatted and any police calls made on Saturday have 'nothing to do with Kim.'<br>","date":"\n  23:39 GMT, 4 March 2017\n<br>","type":"news"},{"source":"Dailymail<br>","url":"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/tvshowbiz\/article-4282046\/Kourtney-Kardashian-wraps-sheets.html","title":"In bed with Kourtney!

Syringe v bottle: We test the best way to banish those wrinkles<br>","content":"Botox, the wrinkle-smoothing injection that was long the preserve of Hollywood, is more popular and widely accepted than ever. But for most people, the thought of injections, and their cost, means it will never be an option.This created a gap in the market, readily filled by a sea of skincare products claiming to replicate Botox\u2019s ability to \u2018freeze\u2019 facial muscles or inhibit facial expression. But can they?There seemed one obvious way to put them to the test: volunteer my own forehead for a half-and-half trial, by using so-called \u2018Botox gels\u2019 on one side, and having the injections on the other.    <br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\n    Clear result: Alice Hart-Davis with a Botox-treated right side of her forehead and still-wrinkled left sideMy Botox trial took place at the Phi Clinic in Harley Street with medical director Dr Tapan Patel.After marking up the wrinkle pattern on my forehead and around my eyes, he injected Botox just to the right side of my brow, and around the crow\u2019s-feet wrinkles at the side of my right eye.He said: \u2018We use Botox to treat lines caused by muscle contraction such as frown lines between the eyebrows. Botox has a specific action whereby it stops nerves passing messages to muscles and prevents them from contracting. When we treat a patient with Botox, we inject it into very specific places to get the overall aesthetic result.\u2019While the Botox was settling in (it can take two weeks to be effective), I tested the contenders, which are UK market leaders.\u00a0First was Biotulin Supreme, a gel that allegedly counts the Duchess of Cambridge, Michelle Obama, Madonna and Kim Kardashian in its fan base.\u00a0I put it on, and watched and waited; no result. No feeling of tightening or numbness. I\u2019m left wondering how it could have reduced wrinkles in the clinical tests the product\u2019s packaging says took place.<br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\nMichelle Obama, Madonna and Kim Kardashian are all fans of anti-ageing creams that recreate the effects of botox\u00a0After a few days with no discernible results, I moved on to Rodial\u2019s Snake Serum O2. It\u2019s lighter than a cream or gel, in glamorous packaging, and my skin drinks it in.Having been told by a Rodial spokesman that results are instant, I watched my face keenly each time I applied it \u2013 but again, there was absolutely no result. A week later, with my forehead and crow\u2019s-feet muscles as active as ever, I moved on to my last hope, Argireline Solution 10% from The Ordinary.This is a watery liquid in basic packaging but I know the main ingredient \u2013 the peptide Argireline. An independent study published in the International Journal Of Cosmetic Science in 2002 reckoned that Argireline at a ten per cent concentration reduced wrinkles around the eyes by 30 per cent over the course of a month.I souse the left side of my face in Argireline Solution for ten days but as yet, there\u2019s no change.                            What it says on the bottle...\u00a0                                                            Supreme Skin Gel, by Biotulin    <br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\n    CLAIM: Biotulin gel is clinically proven to reduce wrinkle depth by up to 25 per cent within an hour due to the anaesthetic spilanthol, which freezes facial muscles.\u00a347, biotulin.comArgireline Solution 10%, by The Ordinary    <br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\n    CLAIM: Independent study in International Journal Of Cosmetic Science in 2002 said Argireline at a ten per cent concentration reduced wrinkles around eyes by 30 per cent in a month.\u00a0\u00a35.50, victoriahealth.comSnake Serum O2, by Rodial    <br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\n    CLAIM: The key ingredient is Syn-Ake dipeptide, a \u2018wrinkle-freezing\u2019 ingredient that smooths the skin by mimicking the effects of Temple Viper venom.\u00a3130, rodial.co.uk                                                    When I return to Dr Patel two weeks later, the Botox has started to work, damping down all the muscles on the right side of my face and around my right eye, while the left side is behaving as normal.\u2018I\u2019m not at all surprised to see the cosmetic application had no effect,\u2019 says Dr Patel. \u2018There are numerous products with similar claims.\u2018Even if by some stroke of luck they did work, how would we be able to dose them or apply them to unique areas?\u2019    <br \/>\n    <br \/>\n      <br \/>\n<br \/>\n    A young woman having a Botox injection (file image)Because I live in hope, I will continue using the Argirelene for the rest of the month. Just in case.I have put myself through many bizarre experiments in the name of beauty journalism, and this has to be one of the oddest. But if it helps to make the point that these much-hyped \u2018Botox-without-the-needles\u2019 potions produce no discernible effect, it will have been worth it. And the products? They will simply remain hope in a jar.Rodial said: \u2018We always recommend that our customers choose the correct product to cater to their own age and skin concern, and use the product for up to 28 days to see maximum results.\u2019Brandon Truaxe, spokesman for The Ordinary, said: \u2018Argireline peptides cannot reach deeper muscles than a needle can reach readily and the peptide itself is simply not anywhere as toxic (effective) as botulinum toxin.
